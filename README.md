# Acting
Online multiplayer theater system built with Unity (XR Plugin, Universal Render Pipeline) and Normcore

Goal is to enable multiple actors to do an improv scene, each using Oculus Quests.  

Working (in "Sketch" project):
* Normcore VR multiplayer working (basic avatars, with voice chat, mouth movement)
* Basic "theater-in-the-round" set with spotlights
* On-stage props (hats, etc.)
* 3D drawing ("brush")
* Implemented mirror (using https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/standard-ar-vr-mirror-shaders-118971)
* Running on Oculus Quest under Unity 2019.3.14f1

Next steps:
* Touch control button presses for: mirror on/off
* Avatar customization (change "costumes")
* Improve drawing feature (choose paint color, add objects)
* Enable AR viewing of the performance (per https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/using-ar-as-spectator.html)
* See [Github Issues list](https://github.com/tedbarnett/Acting/issues) above

Starting with basic Normcore features to get multiplayer voice chat working.  Had good luck with the basic Normcore drawing tutorial https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/creating-a-multiplayer-drawing-app.html

Collaborators appreciated.
